# Softwares for programming the Spike hub:

We first used the Lego Spike desktop application which can be downloaded from the Lego Educations website 
and used an online editor that can be opened in a browser that supports connecting to the hub (we used Google Chrome)

# Software for programming the Mindstorms hub:

We used the official Mindstorms app(we downloaded it from microsoft store)

Fortunately we did not needed any downloadable extensions because the mindorms app supports machine learning and we used that
to indentify any obstacle (you can apply it when you open block extensions in the bottom left corner).
