    <td> We all go to Kandó Kálmán Computer Science Secondary School and we love Lego spike and EV3 Robots and challanges and that is why we want to go to this competition.
We had a hard time building the robot because we think that this competition needs a camera to have a high score but we did not had any camera so we tried to make a lego robot with color and distance sensors we will try to get the highest score we can get making the robot travel safe as possible
Our Goal was to build a self driving car from arduino or lego. Unfortunately we can not build the car with arduino because some of us did not had much knowledge about it. So we built it from the lego spike kit.</td>
