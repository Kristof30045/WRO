# 1. Prototype
![robot](../v-photos/left.jpg)

1. **Considerations**  
      - High manoeuvrability  
      - Narrow width  
      - Easy variability of sensor placement  
      - We wanted to build the robot from the Spike kit  
      - Camera (unfortunately this was not available)

2. **Construction**  
      - Steering gear design with pivot, also known as waist articulation, agreed in advance by e-mail.  
      - Size: 290x100x150 cm  
      - Weight: 605g  
      - Components:  
        - The robot was built from the Lego Spike kit  
        - Lego Spike Brick  
        - Size of the 4 wheels: 56x16mm  
      - Sensors:  
        - 2 distance sensors  
        - 4 axis built-in gyroscope  
        - 1 colour sensor (motor driven by an arm design to identify obstacles to be avoided from above)  
      - Motors:  
        - 3 medium motors:  
          - To rotate the colour sensor  
          - To rotate the steering  
          - To move the robot
      - Camera phone:
            - connection to the hub via Bluetooth.
